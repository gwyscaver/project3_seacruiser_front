# SeaCruiser - Chat app:  Project 3

SeaCruiser is a chat app bringing together fellow cruisers on their specified vessel and sailing dates.

The goal of the app is to allow users to meet potential cruisers either before their cruise sets sail or while cruising the high seas on-board the ship.

Currently, an app for this market does not exist.
